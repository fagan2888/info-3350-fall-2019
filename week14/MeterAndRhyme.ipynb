    "# Meter and Rhyme\n",
    "\n",
    "For our last week, we're going to focus on poetry. Today we'll work with specific poems to get a sense of how well we can analyze characteristics like rhyme and meter. On Friday we will take a more macro view and consider a large collection of poems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are doing a project instead of the final, you must present a 5-minute work-in-progress presentation in the Friday after-class session or make a separate arrangement with course staff.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us analyze the *sound* of language, we'll use the `pronouncing` package by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/), a professor at NYU. This package is a wrapper around the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meter review.** The metrical structure of a line of poetry, even just English-language poetry, is really complicated, and there is basically nothing that is universally agreed upon. But a common formalism is that a line of metrical poetry is divided into *feet*, which have a specific stress pattern. The most common is the *iamb* (duh-DAH, or in metrical notation ⏑/). Five iambs in a line makes *iambic pentameter*. Other common feet include the dactyl (/⏑⏑), anapest (⏑⏑/), and trochee (/⏑)."
